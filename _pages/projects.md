## <i>Modelling Customer and Product Profiles for Quick and Better Recommendations</i>
### Tesco Bengaluru, India (June–July 2019)
* Objective: To build a recommendation system that models customer and product profiles
* Role: Used Neo4j to model recommendation system and implemented collaborative filtering and Market-Based
Analysis; Created Customer-Transaction Graph and Basket-Basket Graph out of data to extract profiles; Presented
results through a UI with REST APIs that internally connect to Neo4j database for querying; Developed the model
in a dataset with 60 customers, over 17000 products, and 5500 orders
* Tools: Neo4j, Python, Cypher (Query Language)

## <i>Test Framework</i>
### Tesco Bengaluru, India (November–January 2019)
* Objective: To create a Test Framework to test the APIs in a unified fashion
* Role: Created a test framework to test the APIs in a unified fashion across all deployment environments and
business channels to ease out the development process.
* Tools Used: Spring, Junit5, Embedded Kafka
