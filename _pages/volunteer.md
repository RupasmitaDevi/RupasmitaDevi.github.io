I have worked under the project “Shiksha ki Ore” as part of the BITS Pilani Chapter of the NGO, Nirmaan Organisation. The project aims at providing free tuitions to the underprivileged kids. We also admitted the kids to schools through the Right to Education Act of 2009. The volunteers are the university students who make regular visits to the community by managing out quality time out of the busy schedules. This exposure taught me time management and team building, and also helped me realise my potentials to give back value to the community.
