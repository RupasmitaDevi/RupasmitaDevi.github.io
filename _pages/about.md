Hello, I am Rupasmita from Assam, India. I have always been fascinated by numbers and love indulging in problem-solving. I feel data-driven insight is the strongest source of truth to arrive at a decision. I completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science from BITS Pilani in 2018 and had been working as a Software Developer at Tesco Bengaluru Pvt. Ltd. from 2018 to 2020. I have recently joined Trinity College Dublin in the class of 2021 to pursue graduate studies in Computer Science with specialisation in Data Science.
