Hello, I am Rupasmita from Assam, India. I have always been fascinated by numbers and love indulging in problem-solving. I completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science from BITS Pilani in 2018 and have worked as a Software Developer at Tesco Bengaluru Pvt. Ltd. from 2018 to 2020. I have recently joined Trinity College Dublin in the class of 2021 to pursue graduate studies in Computer Science with specialisation in Data Science.

Working as a software developer for
more than 2 years, I have got hands-on with the in-demand trends of building APIs with microservices reactive programming, Springboot, event-driven design and development, CI/CD, logging, caching, etc. I love indulging in data-driven approaches to solve real-world issues and therefore I have decided to pursue graduate studies with an emphasis on Data Science.

I am looking for roles where I can contribute wholesomely to effective decision making, design, and development in building resilient services.
