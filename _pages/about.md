Hello, I am Rupasmita from Assam, India. I have always been fascinated by numbers and love indulging in problem-solving. I feel data-driven insight is the strongest source of truth to arrive at a decision. I completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science from BITS Pilani in 2018 and have been working as a Software Developer at Tesco Bengaluru Pvt. Ltd. since then.
